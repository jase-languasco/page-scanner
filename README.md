Page Scanner

The PHP is very basic and can most likely run on PHP 5 and greater all the way to the current newest version of 7. The JavaScript is utilizing ES6 and is vanilla JavaScript.

This program will run on a basic PHP server. The code that parses the page is in PHP, or else this could would run purley client-side. There may be a way to parse a page on the client side, but I haven't figured it out yet.
